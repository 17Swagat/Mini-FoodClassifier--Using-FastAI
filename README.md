# **Food Classifier**

**This is a mini-experiment conducted after finishing Lectures `01` and `02` of the `FastAI course`. The goal is to classify images of `Sushi`, `Steak`, and `Pizza`.**

## Dataset
**The dataset used for fine-tuning is [pizza_steak_sushi.zip](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/tree/main/data) from the PyTorch Tutorial by [Daniel Bourke](https://www.learnpytorch.io/04_pytorch_custom_datasets/).**

## Model
**Fine-tuning the pretrained `Resnet34` model for only 3 epochs surprisingly gave quite accurate results in a very short time.**

## Results
**Check the last section of `FoodClassifier.ipynb`.**
